# Twitter Analytics Dashboard || Power-BI

### ‚û°Ô∏è Introduction :-

- This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to help us understand social media engagement and performance better. 

- By exploring various metrics, such as impressions, engagements, and interactions, this dashboard helps provide insights that can drive better decision-making for content strategy.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Data Source 

Twitter Data : data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=SocialMedia.csv

### ‚û°Ô∏è Tools 

- PowerBI- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Creating Dashboards & Data Visualization


### ‚û°Ô∏è Background:-

- In today‚Äôs digital world, social media platforms like Twitter play a crucial role in brand communication and user engagement. 

- Analyzing these interactions is essential to gauge what content resonates with the audience. 

- This project aims to create a comprehensive Twitter Analytics Dashboard to track these activities and understand the trends that drive engagement.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Learning Objectives :-

- To gain practical skills in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.

- To understand Twitter‚Äôs engagement metrics and derive actionable insights.

- To learn how to handle real-world social media data and create meaningful visualizations for reporting purposes.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Activities :-

- Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of each activity you completed in the data preparation phase:

#### 1) Data Loading and Inspection
   
- The data from Twitter was loaded into Power BI for analysis. This involved importing the dataset and reviewing its structure to ensure that all necessary fields (such as impressions, engagement, likes, retweets, timestamps, etc.) were present.

- After loading, we examined the data types and any potential discrepancies, such as missing values, to confirm data integrity before starting any transformations or calculations.

#### 2) Cleaning and Processing Twitter Data for Relevant Metrics

The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process. This included:
- Removing any duplicate entries to ensure accurate metrics.
- Handling missing values either by filling them in with reasonable defaults (if applicable) or removing records where data was insufficient.
- Extracting or converting date and time values to separate columns, like ‚ÄúTweet Date‚Äù and ‚ÄúTweet Hour,‚Äù to facilitate time-based filtering and analysis.
- Additionally, columns for specific metrics, like ‚ÄúEngagement Rate,‚Äù ‚ÄúImpressions,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRetweets,‚Äù were formatted correctly for further calculations.

#### 3) Creating KPIs for Impressions, Engagement Rates, Retweets, and Other Metrics

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were created to summarize critical metrics:
- Total Impressions: The total count of views the tweets received.
- Engagement Rate: Calculated as (Engagements / Impressions) * 100 to provide a percentage view of audience interaction.
- Total Retweets and Likes: These individual metrics were set up as KPIs to track tweet popularity and engagement levels.
- These KPIs helped establish a clear view of how tweets performed over time and by specific categories (e.g., media vs. non-media).

#### 4) Designing Visualizations for Media vs. Non-Media Tweet Performance, Peak Engagement Times, and Interaction Breakdowns

Various charts and visual elements were created to visualize performance data:
- Media vs. Non-Media Tweets: A comparison chart to show differences in impressions, engagement, and other metrics for tweets containing media (images, videos) versus plain text tweets.
- Peak Engagement Times: A time-based visualization showing which hours and days resulted in the highest engagement, helping identify the best times for posting.
- Interaction Breakdown: Separate visuals for types of interactions, like likes, retweets, replies, and URL clicks, allowed for an in-depth understanding of user responses to tweets.

#### 5) Developing Filters for Specific Data Views

To allow targeted data analysis, several filters were added:
- Time-Based Filters: These filters allow selection of tweets within specific hours or time ranges (e.g., only tweets posted between 9 AM and 5 PM).
- Conditional Filters: Additional conditions, like only showing tweets with even-numbered impressions or tweets posted on weekdays, were set up to provide granular insights.
- These filters enable viewers to dynamically adjust the visualizations for different analytical needs, such as identifying weekday vs. weekend performance or focusing on tweets with high impressions.
- These steps provided a clean and structured dataset, along with powerful visualizations and flexible filtering, allowing for comprehensive Twitter analytics.

### ‚û°Ô∏è TASKS :-

#### üí† TASK-1
- Create a visual that shows the average engagement rate and total impressions for tweets posted between '01- 01-2020' and '30-06-2020'. Filter out tweets that received fewer than 100 impressions and like should be 0 and this graph should work only between 3Pm to 5 PM IST apart from that we should not show the graph.

#### üí† TASK-2
- Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work between 3 PM to 6 PM and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30.

#### üí† TASK-3
- Analyse tweets to show a comparison of the engagement rate for tweets with app opens versus tweets without app opens. Include only tweets posted between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays and this graph should work between 12 PM to 6 PM and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 40.
